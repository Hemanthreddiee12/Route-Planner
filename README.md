#Route-Planner #Dijkstra 

This is a basic route planner using shortes path algorithm.
Local Bus Route Planner, an innovative software that streamlines bus travel for commuters. This
cutting-edge system employs Dijkstra’s algorithm to pinpoint
the best routes, tailored to user preferences. It offers three
distinct transportation modes to accommodate various needs:
Own Transport, Shortest Time Path via Public Transport, and
Cheapest Price Path via Public Transport. Say goodbye to
inefficient bus journeys with this efficient and user-friendly
tool.The implementation utilizes a graph-based depiction of the
bus network, with vertices representing bus stops and edges illustrating the links between stops. These vertices contain valuable
data on bus categories, distances, and estimated travel times.
Multiple bus types are accommodated by the application, each
distinguished by its unique velocity, fare, and designated route.
Streamlit is utilized for the system’s user interface, enabling
users to easily input their starting and ending points on a map
and select their preferred mode of transportation. The software
delivers real-time solutions, taking into account factors such as
distance, time, and cost to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
